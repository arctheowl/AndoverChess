## Customization

### Colors
The website uses a custom emerald color scheme. You can modify the colors in the Tailwind configuration or by updating the CSS classes throughout the components.

### Content
All content is currently hardcoded in the components. For a production site, you would want to:
- Connect to a CMS (like Contentful, Strapi, or Sanity)
- Use a database for dynamic content
- Implement an admin panel for content management

### Contact Form
The contact form currently simulates submission. For production, you'll need to:
- Connect to an email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
- Add proper form validation
- Implement spam protection

## Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Deploy automatically

### Netlify
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Upload the `out` directory to Netlify

### Other Platforms
The project can be deployed to any static hosting platform that supports Next.js.
